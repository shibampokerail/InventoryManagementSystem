# Inventory Management Dashboard Backend files
### Visit the wiki page and use the api manual for the process of technical testing.

To make this code work, you need to have a .env file in your flask-mongodb-api folder. the env is suppose to have the following arguments:

- SECRET_KEY=
- SLACKBOT_API_KEY=

- USERNAME = 
- PASSWORD = 
- HOST = 
- PORT = 
- DB_NAME = 

After this you have to create a virtual envirnment to install all dependicies.
python3 -m venv pathto/myvenv

then so source /venv/bin/activate

after that you need to install all dependencies with 
pip install -r requirements.txt

Once this setup is complete you can run the main.py app.
Make sure you env is currectly configured.
